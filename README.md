## Drinks App
The Drinks App is a simple web application built using React that allows users to search for drinks and add new drinks to the database. It demonstrates how to create a basic front-end interface for managing a list of drinks, search for specific drinks, and add new drinks to the list. In this README, we'll provide an overview of the application and explain how to set it up and run it locally.

## Features
* Search Drinks: Users can search for drinks by entering a keyword in the search input field. The application filters the list of drinks to display those matching the search criteria.

* Add New Drink: Users can add a new drink by providing a name, image URL, and category. The new drink is added to the list of drinks displayed on the page.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Drinks App, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

* Node.js: You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.
## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Drinks App on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/drinks-app.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project folder:
    cd drinks-app

3. Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
    npm install

4. Start the Application: Once the installation is complete, you can start the application with the following command: npm run dev

This command will launch the development server, and the application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3002.

## Usage
* Search for Drinks: In the search bar, enter a keyword or part of a drink's name, and click the "Search" button. The app will display a list of drinks that match your search criteria.

* Add a New Drink: To add a new drink to the list, fill out the "Name," "Image," and "Category" fields in the form and click the "Add New Drink" button.

## Project Structure
The project structure is divided into a single component named "Drinks" that handles the functionality of the application. The component contains state management, API calls, and rendering logic.

* src/Drinks.js: The main component responsible for displaying the list of drinks, handling search functionality, and adding new drinks.
## Technologies Used
* React: The front-end framework for building the user interface and managing application state.
* React Hooks: Utilized to manage state and side effects in functional components.
* REST API: The application communicates with a RESTful API to retrieve and add drinks. You may need to provide your own API or server for this functionality.
